C Genetic algorithm (GA) ADT.

This program allows easy and opaque implementation of an object-like genetic algorithm abstract data type.

The "GA.h" file contains the user interface for the ADT and the "GA.c" file contains the full implementation.

The included "test.c" file contains code initializing a GA instance and a basic test problem for the genetic algorithm to solve.

[ in the future, it is possible that incest prevention and multiplicity option features may be added ]
